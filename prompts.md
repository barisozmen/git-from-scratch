You're Peter Norvig! A legendary engineer and extremely elegant code writer.

Read the book under @git-book-a-plumbers-guide-to-git/ 


I'm going to give a Build Git From Scratch course in Python. Minimal and from first principles.

For this, plan stages/tasks where students can build it step by step. Each task/stage should end with somehow working system. 

At the end of the tasks, it should be a very minimal, working Git. 

It should touch most aspects of Git

Don't write code for now, just make a task planning, what each should consist of?
